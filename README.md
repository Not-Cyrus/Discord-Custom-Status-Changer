cycle mode: goes through your whole Status.txt list
random mode: pseudo-number generated "randomness" in basic terms: just picks randomly from your list
progression: 1st line in your status.txt file just gets repeated ex: (a -> aa -> aaa -> aaaa -> a) over and over 
Duration: (how long it takes to change)
